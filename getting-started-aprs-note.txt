setup el cheapo radios to send and receive aprs
setup baofeng to send and receive aprs
baofeng setting VOX  and set it to 1 (remember to turn off vox when the tnc2 is not plugged in or you will be transmitting all the time ) dont know if vox was necessary
but we were probably just using the wrong channel
make sure that the boufeng is pointing to the right frequency a/b

there should be a way to activate the transmission without using vox

with the el cheapo the squelch has to be open or it wont receive in time 
we may need to program them to keep it open all the time
because the squelch opens too slowly to get the entire signal

hooking it up with raspberrypi and fldigi
now you have a mobile system that can store and forward messages

Could evne be a really simple mesh network for store and forward and messaging

then you can link this up with the city wide mesh network
and get messaging through the broadband

NEXT step
figure out how to use secure scuttlebutt to send secure messages over aprs

inspiration is Airchat

Remember to make an addendum to previous post and talk about the SSID on 
the WAP

direwolf plus secure scuttlebutt

aprs data format
http://aprs.net/vm/DOS/PROTOCOL.HTM



QUERIES:  THere are two types of APRS Queries.  One is general to all
stations and the other is in a message format to a single station:



  ?APRS?                    Queries all stations (respond in 2 mins)
  ?APRS?LLLLLL,OOOOOO,RRRR  Queries a radius around a LAT/LONG point
                            If RRR is less than 8 then respond immediately
  ?WX?                      Queries all WX stations
  W3ABC____:?APRS?          Queries just W3ABC  (all of his data)
  W3ABC____:?APRSP          Queries for  W3ABC's Posit
  W3ABC____:?APRSS          Queries for  W3ABC's Status
  W3ABC____:?APRSM          Queries for  W3ABC's messages
  W3ABC____:?APRSO          Queries for  W3ABC's Objects
  W3ABC____:?APRSD          Queries for stations heard DIRECT by W3ABC
  W3ABC____:?APRSH W4XYZ    Queries to see if W3ABC has heard W4XYZ
                            W3ABC sends back a packet with W4XYZ as an OBJ
                            and sends back a message with the number of
                            packets heard per hour from him.


Ax.25 and aprs

aprs data format and field sizes
theoretical limits to how much you can send in a packet over vhf and still get reliable data even with FEC
how many nodes can you have before APRS becomes impractical (too noisy or too crowded)
does combining scuttlebutt with aprs query mean you can theoretically have more conversations because you are not 
indesciminately broadcasting?
get a good understanding of the limitations of ax25/fx25 and aprs
look into amprnet
high level data link control HDLC v KISS is it relevant to what we are doing?
What alternaticves ae there like packet radio or digital modes? 
what is the relationship between packet radio and ax25? can you do packet radio without ax25, some otehr protocol?
Where does AX.25 stop and APRS begin?
Which frequencies in 2m and 70cm in the band plan are dedicated to data (packet) _other_ than 144.390 (APRS)? Potential
    for point-to-point communication of data not suitable for APRS, but can negotiate as side-channels _via_ APRS first. 
can you expose a webservice over bluetooth instad of wifi?
FInd out more about the aprs query message.


Check if direwolf can do fx25
what else is it capable of?

Pi zero/ orange pi radios
software modem on tiny computer
make them igates too 
(over wifi as well as using a connected cell phone that has a data connection as well as to the AREDN mesh)
can you hack the firmware to transmit over the ham wifi 



setup a digipeater and an igate
remember proportional pathing
http://www.aprs.org/newN/ProportionalPathing.txt

can we make these things talk to the satellites?
